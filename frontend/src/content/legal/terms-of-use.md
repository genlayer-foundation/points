The Foundation maintains the Site as a portal for information, news and updates in order to independently support, educate and encourage the use and adoption of trust infrastructure for autonomous systems through Intelligent Contracts and decentralized AI consensus and related infrastructure and digital assets related thereto (collectively, the "**Ecosystem**"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Foundation does not control the Ecosystem or the blockchains or other infrastructure upon which the Ecosystem operates and cannot control activity and/or data in connection with the Ecosystem.

The Foundation is based in the Cayman Islands. We make no claims that the Site or any of its content is accessible or appropriate outside of the Cayman Islands. Access to the Site may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Site from outside the Cayman Islands, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

Please read these Terms of Uses carefully, as these Terms govern your use, rights and obligations as well as our disclaimers and limitations of legal liability in respect of the Site, including, without limitation, (a) any user interface operated by the Foundation that facilitates access to the Site and/or the Ecosystem, and (b) the forum related to governance of the Site and/or the Ecosystem (such services, collectively, the "**Services**"). If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, then you must not access or use the Site or the Services.

**By clicking "I agree" (or a similar language) to these Terms of Use, acknowledging these Terms by other means, or otherwise accessing or using the Site or the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by and to comply with these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, then you must not access or use the Site or the Services.**

**These Terms of Use do not govern any activity in which you may engage involving cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based assets (collectively, "Digital Assets") or otherwise outside of the Site, including any transactions in which you may engage using the Ecosystem or any unaffiliated platforms or websites. We disclaim any and all liability as well as warranty in this regard.**

**1. MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TOU**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify these Terms of Use from time to time at our sole discretion. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by providing notice through the Services or updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms of Use. It's important that you review the Terms of Use whenever we update them or you use the Site and/or access the Services. Unless we state otherwise in our notice, all such modifications are effective immediately, and your continued use of the Site and the Services after we provide that notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms of Use, then you must stop using the Site and the Services. We may change or discontinue all or any part of the Site and/or the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

We may, at our sole discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to you, modify, suspend or disable (temporarily or permanently) the Site and the Services, in whole or in part, for any reason (or no reason) whatsoever. Upon termination of your access, your right to access or use the Site or the Services will immediately cease. We will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification to the Site or any Services or from any modification, suspension, or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or any portion of the Site or the Services. Sections 7 through 16 of these Terms of Use will survive any termination of your access to the Site or the Services, regardless of the reasons for its expiration or termination, in addition to any other provision which by law or by its nature should survive.

**11. RISKS**

A. By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Site in any way, you represent and warrant that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks; Digital Assets, including the usage and intricacies of native Digital Assets and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. The Foundation does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (a) that the Foundation is not responsible for the operation of the software and networks underlying the Services, (b) that there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (c) that the underlying networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as "forks," which may materially affect the Services. Blockchain networks use public/private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to Digital Assets on the relevant blockchain or other blockchain-based network. Neither the Foundation nor any other person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your Digital Assets. If your private key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to transfer your Digital Assets to any other blockchain address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value or utility from the Digital Assets that you may hold.

B. The Services and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of the Foundation to continue to make available its proprietary software and, thus, could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services.

C. You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and the smart contract to which the Services facilitate access, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. We are unable to update Foundation-developed smart contracts to which the Services provide access for any advances in cryptography or to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements; thus, there can be no guarantee regarding the full security of smart contracts to which the Services facilitate access.

D. You understand that most blockchains remain under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services to facilitate access to smart contracts in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the a blockchain is generally variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services.

E. You acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Services or Site. This warning and others the Foundation provides in these Terms of Use in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Services or accessing the Site.

F. Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Services, the Site and other information available when using the Services may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site or as part of the Services are your sole responsibility.

G. Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.

H. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you.

I. We must comply with Applicable Laws, which may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take certain actions or provide information, which may not be in your best interests.

J. **You hereby assume, and agree that the Foundation will have no responsibility or liability for, the risks set forth in this Section 11. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against the Foundation, its affiliates, and their respective shareholders, members, council, directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, suppliers, and contractors related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 11.**

**12. INDEMNIFICATION AND THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS**

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Foundation, its affiliates, and its and its affiliates' respective shareholders, members, council, directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, and contractors (collectively, "**Indemnified Parties**") from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or relating to (a) your use of, or conduct in connection with, the Site or the Services; (b) Digital Assets associated with your blockchain wallet address; (c) any feedback or user content you provide to the Foundation, if any, concerning the Site or the Services; (d) your violation of these Terms of Use; or (e) your infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity. If you are obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party, the Foundation (or, at its discretion, the applicable Indemnified Party) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether the Foundation wishes to settle, and if so, on what Terms of Use, and you agree to corporate with the Foundation in the defence. For the purposes of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Revised) of the Cayman Islands each Indemnified Party that is not a party to these Terms of Use is an intended third-party beneficiary under these Terms of Use. However, the parties to these Terms of Use may rescind or vary these Terms of Use in accordance with the provisions set out herein (including any variation so as to extinguish or alter a third party's entitlement to enforce any provisions of these Terms of Use) without the consent of any such third party.

Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that the Site or the Services (including any data relating thereto) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular time, or error-free.

**The disclaimer of implied warranties contained herein may not apply if and to the extent such warranties cannot be excluded or limited under the Applicable Law of the jurisdiction in which you reside.**

**14. EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES**

In no event shall the Foundation, its affiliates, its suppliers and contractors, and its and its affiliates', suppliers' and contractors' respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, and contractors (collectively, the "Risk Limited Parties") be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of fiat, assets, data, information, revenue, opportunities, use, goodwill, profits or other business or financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with the Site and the Services, any performance or non-performance of the Services, your Digital Assets or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of the Foundation, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability, breach of warranties, or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not we have been advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these Terms of Use or any limited remedy hereunder.

**15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

**In no event shall the Foundation's aggregate liability (together with its affiliates, including its and its affiliates' respective shareholders, members, directors, managers, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, or contractors) arising out of or in connection with the Site and the Services (and any of their content and functionality), any performance or non-performance of the Services, your Digital Assets, or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of the Foundation, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability or other theory of liability exceed US\$100.**

**THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE FOUNDATION AND YOU.**

**16. GOVERNING LAW AND FORUM CHOICE**

These Terms of Use and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties expressly consent to personal and exclusive jurisdiction in the courts located in the Cayman Islands, and you and the Foundation each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
